  This is the index.html for our final project. It includes the html for the
  main page giving the user a main introduction to our page, product images
  and information, as well as a feedback area.

  All images are our own that we had taken from our phone in the past and
  therefore are not cited in the html. If necessary, we may add this in the
  footer so the user is clear that it is ours.

          We are Catalina and Liana and we are excited to bring you our carefully cultivated
          collection of natural artifacts. Inspired by [and based in] the natural beauty of the
          Pacific Northwest, our goal is for life pieces from all around the world to reach
          <span id="italics">you.</span> From the thousand stars caladium to the common vermont
          pebble - we offer you the chance to display beautiful pieces of the world in your home.
